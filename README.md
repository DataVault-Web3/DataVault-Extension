# Order History Extension

A Chrome extension that requests user consent to access Amazon order history with a modern Web3-style interface.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¨ **Web3-Style UI**: Modern, gradient-based design with glass-morphism effects
- ðŸ”’ **Privacy-First**: Explicit consent required before any data access
- ðŸ“¦ **Order History Extraction**: Attempts to extract order data from various Amazon pages

## How It Works

1. **Visit Amazon**: Navigate to any Amazon.com page

   - **Decline**: Modal closes and no data is accessed
4. **View Results**: Open Developer Tools (F12) and check the Console tab for extracted data
